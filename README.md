# Bangla Sentence Reverser

A fun and creative project that reverses Bangla sentences in an unconventional way. Unlike traditional string reversal, this method alters not only the character order but also the structure of the words in a sentence. For example, "‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶Æ‡¶® ‡¶Ü‡¶õ‡ßã" becomes "‡¶õ‡ßã‡¶Ü ‡¶®‡¶Æ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßÅ".

> **Project Duration**: Completed in 2021 as a fun self-learning initiative

## üß† Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a **fun exploration** of manipulating Bangla text in a way that goes beyond traditional string reversal. It doesn't just reverse the characters of each word; it also switches the order of words in a sentence, creating a playful transformation.

For example:
- **Input:** "‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶Æ‡¶® ‡¶Ü‡¶õ‡ßã"
- **Output:** "‡¶õ‡ßã‡¶Ü ‡¶®‡¶Æ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßÅ"

Another example:
- **Input:** "‡¶Ö‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶≤‡¶ø‡ßü‡¶æ"
- **Output:** "‡ßü‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶Ö"

This project demonstrates how string manipulation can be done while keeping language rules in mind. It's a simple yet entertaining take on text processing.
