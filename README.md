# BanglaReverser
A fun project that reverses Bangla sentences in a unique way, where not just the characters, but the order of words and their structure is altered. For example, the sentence "তুমি কেমন আছো" becomes "ছোআ নমকে মিতু". This is different from traditional string reversal because it accounts for the characteristics of the Bengali language.
